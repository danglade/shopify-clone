# Shopify Clone Feature Roadmap: Clothing Store

This document outlines the features to be built for the Shopify clone project, with a specific focus on creating an e-commerce platform for a clothing store. The project is divided into phases to ensure a structured development process.

## Phase 1: Core Product Management

This phase focuses on building the foundational backend capabilities for managing products. The store owner will interact with these features through a private admin dashboard.

### Features:
- **Product Data Model**:
  - **Name**: The title of the clothing item (e.g., "Men's Classic Crewneck T-Shirt").
  - **Slug**: A unique, URL-friendly identifier for the product (e.g., `mens-classic-crewneck-t-shirt`). This will be auto-generated from the name but can be overridden.
  - **Description**: A rich-text enabled field to describe the product, including material, fit, and care instructions.
  - **Price**: The retail price of the item.
  - **Images**: Support for uploading multiple high-resolution product images.
  - **Categories**: Ability to assign products to categories (e.g., "T-Shirts", "Jeans", "Outerwear").
  - **Status**: The state of the product (`Draft`, `Published`, `Archived`).
- **Product Variants**:
  - A system to define variations of a single product. For clothing, this will primarily be:
    - **Size**: (e.g., XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL)
    - **Color**: (e.g., "White", "Black", "Navy Blue")
  - Each unique combination of variants (e.g., Medium, Navy Blue) will have its own:
    - **SKU** (Stock Keeping Unit) for inventory tracking.
    - **Inventory Level** to track stock.
    - **Product Cost**: The wholesale cost of the variant, used to calculate profit margins.
- **Admin Dashboard - Product Management**:

  - **Image Management**: An interface to upload, reorder, and delete product images.
  - **Product Deletion**: A button to soft-delete a product. This will set its status to "Archived" and remove it from public-facing storefronts without permanently deleting the data.
